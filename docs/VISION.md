# Authrim Vision

**Identity at the edge of everywhere**

Authrim was created to address the growing complexity of digital identity.
Modern services must support multiple authentication methods, authorization models, and evolving identity standards. These requirements introduce operational cost and inconsistency across applications.

Authrim aims to make identity more practical and predictable by providing a platform that is fast, consistent, and straightforward to integrate.

---

## 1. Clear and consistent identity experiences

Identity flows should be reliable and easy to follow.
Authrim focuses on delivering predictable authentication and authorization behavior, reducing unnecessary complexity for end users.

---

## 2. A platform developers can work with

Identity systems often become difficult to implement and maintain.
Authrim emphasizes:

* lightweight integration
* simple operation
* clear, extensible architecture

New standards such as passkeys, ReBAC, VC/DID, and FAPI should be usable without burdening developers.

---

## 3. Identity available everywhere

Authrim runs on an edge architecture, enabling low-latency identity services regardless of where users or applications are located.
The goal is to provide a consistent identity foundation for globally distributed systems.

---

## 4. Early support for new standards

Identity requirements change quickly.
Authrim aims to support new standards early, so services can adopt them without major architectural changes.

---

## 5. A lightweight alternative

Authrim does not aim to replicate large monolithic identity platforms.
Instead, it provides only the components that matter most, with an emphasis on clarity and practicality over complexity.

---

# Direction

Authrim will continue to focus on:

* consistent identity flows
* edge-powered performance
* lightweight integration and maintenance
* adaptability to new identity standards

The goal is to make identity systems easier to understand, operate, and evolve.
